# Authentication Fixes Summary

## Problems Fixed

1. **Sign In button was going to wrong route**
   - Fixed: Changed from `/admin` to `/login` in:
     - `/app/page.tsx` (main navbar)
     - `/app/signup/page.tsx` (signup page link)

2. **Signup was not creating Supabase auth users**
   - Fixed: Modified `/app/api/organizations/route.ts` to:
     - Create Supabase auth user first using `supabase.auth.signUp()`
     - Then create database records with the auth user ID
     - Store hashed password in database as backup

3. **Demo accounts were not in Supabase Auth**
   - Created: `/scripts/setup-demo-auth.js` to create demo accounts in Supabase
   - Created: `/SETUP_DEMO_ACCOUNTS.md` with instructions

## Authentication Flow (Now Fixed)

### Sign In Flow
1. User clicks "Sign In" → Goes to `/login`
2. User enters email/password (e.g., demo@sparkleclean.com / demo123)
3. Login form uses `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()`
4. On success → Redirects to `/admin` dashboard
5. Middleware protects `/admin` routes

### Sign Up Flow
1. User clicks "Start Free Trial" → Goes to `/signup`
2. User selects business type
3. User enters business details + email/password
4. Form submits to `/api/organizations` which:
   - Creates Supabase auth user
   - Creates organization in database
   - Creates admin user in database
5. User is logged in and redirected to dashboard

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set up demo accounts (one-time setup)

```bash
# Add service role key to .env.local
echo 'SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"' >> .env.local

# Run setup script
node scripts/setup-demo-auth.js
```

### 2. Test authentication

1. **Test Sign In:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Sign In"
   - Enter: demo@sparkleclean.com / demo123
   - Should redirect to /admin dashboard

2. **Test Sign Up:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Start Free Trial"
   - Complete signup form with new email
   - Should create account and redirect to dashboard

3. **Test Logout:**
   - While logged in, go to /logout-utility
   - Click "Clear All Authentication"
   - Should clear session and redirect to login

## Deployment to Vercel

1. **Add environment variables in Vercel:**
   - All variables from `.env.local`
   - Including `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (for any server-side auth operations)

2. **Run demo account setup after deployment:**
   - Can run locally pointing to production Supabase
   - Or create a deployment script

## Troubleshooting

- **"Invalid login credentials"**: Demo accounts need to be created first
- **Auto-login issue**: Use /logout-utility to clear all auth state
- **Signup fails**: Check Supabase project is active and keys are correct
